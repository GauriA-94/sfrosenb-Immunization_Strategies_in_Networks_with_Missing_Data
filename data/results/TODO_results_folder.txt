* Get rid of redundant files. Make sure there are not .csvs that are in more than one folder. 
	As of the time I wrote this, all the all{netType}Results5and15 and the corresponding new{netType}Results5and15_gamma1_beta095 overlapped

* Pick one naming convention and standardize

* [ACTUALLY MAYBE DONT DO THIS (see note)]Combine all csvs with the same parameters but just different netters ranges into one csv per param set.
	When you do this, keep the "networkVersions{start}thru{end}" part of the name but just make it "networkVersions1thru5000". 
	 If we change the file naming convention it could break backwards compatibility and make it confusing if someone generates new results

	NOTE: Currently by having the files divided up into the different netvers ranges, we skirt githubs hard cap of 100 MB per file. If we combined them we would exceed that I believe.
	

	Could also potentially do one csv for each network type or something more  general, but currently the figure-making code relies on the parameters in the .csv file names
	 so if we wanted to combine the results of multiple param sets into one csv we would have to change all the figure-making code which would be a hassle
 
* Put the other results we ran that don't show up in the paper anywhere in here anyway in case anyone wants to check em out 
 E.g. we still have like 5% and 15% immunization at beta=.120 and .220 for a few cases before we decided on beta=1.7 being the high end (which consequently made 0.95 the middle instead of .120)
